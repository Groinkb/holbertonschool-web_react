/* This is a placeholder for the test file content.
   In a real-world scenario, we would use Jest and related
   testing libraries to test the CourseListRow component.

   Example tests would include:
   - Test that when isHeader prop is true, the cell background color is #deb5b545
   - Test that when isHeader prop is true and secondTextCell is not null, the background color is #deb5b545
   - Test that when isHeader prop is false, the cell background color is #f5f5f5ab
