// Import needed test utilities
/* This is a placeholder for the test file content.
   In a real-world scenario, we would use Jest and related
   testing libraries to test the NotificationItem component.

   Example tests would include:
   - Test that the component renders without crashing
   - Test that the correct HTML is rendered based on type and value props
   - Test that the styling changes based on the type prop
